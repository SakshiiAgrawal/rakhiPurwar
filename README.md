### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a pre-final year CSE Student at BMS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. I am trying out my hands at the new innovations & research in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. I have just started contributing to open source and looking forward to contributing more.
