### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a pre final year CSE Student at BMS Institute of Technology, Bangalore. I am trying out my hands at the new innovations & research in the field of Machine Learning, Deep Learning and AI. I am trying contribute to open source and was a participant at **GirlScript Summer of Code 2020**.
I am a firm believer of lifelong learning which is an essential aspect of thriving as a software engineer which I aspire to become :dizzy:
